Hi! I'm a Cybersecurity Engineering student currently in my 5th semester. I love diving into systems administration, hacking, and networking!

I spend my time hacking boxes at Hack The Box, setting up sysadmin environments, learning German, and just having fun experimenting with all sorts of tech. So far, I've explored a bunch of topics at my university, including networking, Windows and Linux sysadmin, cryptography, ethical hacking, and programming.

In this blog, I'll be sharing walkthroughs of the labs I create and the machines I solve. Soon I will be uploading content in German too!

Enjoy!
